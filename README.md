# EvolutionOfComplexity
This module was an evolutionary algorithms module focusing on theory and research involved in the field of evolution from a compuational perpective. 

* CW1: Coursework 1
    This coursework lays down the foundations of evolutionary algorithms and the foundational comparison between a hill climber. The phrase "Methinks it is like a weasel" is searched for through a hillclimber and natural selection algorithms with and without crossover. This coursework wasn't marked so the code may be more rough than other work. The main function of this work is to introduce the algorithmic foundations of a evolutionary algoritmh: initialising the population, selection, fitness and variation algorithms.
* CW2: Coursework 2:
    
    Coursework was reporducing results of an achedemic paper in the area and expanding on that paper. For this I reproduced the "Individual Selection for Cooperative Group Formation" paper by Simon T. Powers, Alexandra S. Penn and Richard A. Watson. (included in the ./Papers). The expansion was considering a closer to continuous model of greed / cooperative behaviour as the paper uses a binary model.
* Exam / Lecture Notes / Papers: Summaries of exam papers and lecture slides and achademic papers on the topic.
